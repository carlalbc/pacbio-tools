🔍 Error Message Cheat Sheet:

1. [ERROR] Open <...>.obc failed
   → File not found. Check that the .obc files exist in the run folder path.

2. [ERROR] not all tracks contain the same number of reads
   → One or more .obc files might be corrupt or truncated.

3. No output FASTQ generated
   → Check if SampleSheet.csv was loaded and has proper sample/index entries.

4. Undetermined reads only
   → Possibly wrong or mismatched index sequences in the SampleSheet.

💡 Tips:
- Ensure all index sequences are exactly 8 bp long (or match your run settings).
- Confirm lane numbers are correct.
- If unsure about cycle masks or advanced settings, omit them and let the tool auto-detect.
